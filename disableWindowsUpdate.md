****! YES, OP, you can disable Windows Updates permanently.

    Press Windows key + R.

    Type "services.msc" (without quotes) into the little line in the dialog box that comes up.

    Scroll to locate "Windows Update".

    Right click it.

    Click Stop.

    Right click it again when the progress window disappears.

    Click Properties.

    On the drop-down in the following dialog, select "Disabled", which is by the words "Startup type"

    Click Apply, then OK.

    Close the "services.msc" app.

    You don't need to but reboot anyway for good measure.

    Profit.
